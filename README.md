Title: Predicting Energy Utilization of Home Appliances using Regression

Objective: To develop a model that predicts the energy consumption of home appliances based on various factors.

Resources Used:

- Dataset: A comprehensive dataset containing energy consumption patterns of various home appliances, including refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines.
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing the data.
2. Feature Selection: Selected relevant features that impact energy consumption, such as usage patterns, appliance type, and environmental factors.
3. Model Development: Trained and evaluated multiple regression models to predict energy consumption.
4. Model Evaluation: Compared the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model hyperparameters to improve performance.
6. Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model as a web application for users to input data and predict energy consumption.

* By following these steps and utilizing the mentioned resources, the project aims to provide an accurate prediction of energy utilization, enabling homeowners to make informed decisions about their energy usage.*
